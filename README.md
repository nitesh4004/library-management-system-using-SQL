# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 🐱‍👤

##### A Database Management System Course Project containing all the features, SQL scripts, and options to serve as a DBMS for State Town Library 🚀
 
### Introduction:
Our system is based on library management and book-keeping system. This project “Library Management System” contains data relevant to the books present in the library, which can be lent to the customers and details maintained by the staff. Along with the management of the system, we are also maintaining the records of issue statuses and publishers of the books.

### Mission Objective:
The goal of the venture is to give ease in plausibility to both staff and clients. As per this particular interest loaning of books was finished by making enrollment of the client in a branch so that might follow the information applicable to the client as well as to the actual branch. In the interim, clients can produce an issuance status subsequent to getting a book to monitor it. Moreover, the staff is empowered to keep up with and update the situation with every one of the books in the library.
