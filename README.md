# Library Management System by SQL

## Introduction
Our Library Management System is designed to efficiently manage and organize the resources and operations of the State Town Library. This system focuses on book inventory management, customer registration, book lending, and staff administration. It also keeps track of book issuance statuses and publisher information.

## Mission Objective
The primary objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform for both library staff and customers. Key functionalities include:

- **Customer Registration:** Customers can register with the library, providing their personal details and receiving a unique membership ID.
- **Book Catalog:** The system maintains a comprehensive catalog of all library books, including ISBN, title, author, genre, and publisher information.
- **Inventory Management:** Physical copies of books are tracked, indicating the condition of each copy (e.g., new or used).
- **Branch Information:** Details about library branches, such as branch name, address, and contact information, are stored in the system.
- **Loan Management:** Customers can borrow books from the library, with each loan recorded, including the book copy borrowed, customer ID, issue date, and due date.
- **Issuance Status:** Customers can check the status of their borrowed books, helping them keep track of their reading materials.
- **Staff Administration:** Staff members have the capability to update book information, manage customer records, and monitor the status of all books in the library.

This Library Management System is designed to enhance the efficiency of library operations, ensuring that customers can easily access and borrow books while providing staff with tools to maintain and update library resources effectively.
